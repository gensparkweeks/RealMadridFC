#### React
We installed or update node to install React for our Front:
```sh
npm install npm -g 
cd main directory
npx create-react-app rm-frontend
```
We used `SweetAlert2` for alerts:
```sh
npm install --save sweetalert2
```
We worked with `axios` for doing http requests:
```sh
npm install --save react-router-dom
```
And `Moment` for formatting dates:
```sh
npm install --save moment react-moment
```
